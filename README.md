# Warsaw Public Transport Data Analysis

A data analysis project focused on exploring and processing Warsaw's public transportation data. This repository contains tools and notebooks for working with Warsaw Transport Authority (ZTM) data, including:

- Bus routes and stop information
- Public transport timetables
- Geospatial data for bus/tram stops
- Tools for processing and analyzing transport patterns

## Data Sources

The project uses public API data from Warsaw's Urban Information System (API UM Warszawa):
- Stop coordinates and location data
- Timetable information
- Bus and tram route definitions

## Repository Structure

- `data/` - Contains processed CSV files, JSON data from APIs, and parquet files
  - `data/timetable/` - Raw timetable data (excluded from git)
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization
- Python scripts for data fetching and processing
- Documentation from Warsaw Transport Authority

## Getting Started

The main analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebooks. The project uses Python with pandas for data processing.

## Notes

This project is for research and educational purposes. All data is sourced from publicly available Warsaw transport APIs. 

Brief description of exploration of data can be found in the [Google docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ewFo5SRkvxhdMza2mqSiUS3AARcQ3ajPvCTIysygWAU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4qc55alv5ygn).
